This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Synopsis
Here I write a brief summary of the analysis. What did I find?

## Data Processing
How I loaded the data. Did I do anything to tidy it up?
This is me loading the dataset

```{r echo = TRUE}

fileHandle <- "repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2"
stormData <-read.csv(bzfile(fileHandle), header= TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE )

```

## Results





You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
